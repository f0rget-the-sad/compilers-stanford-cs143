## The Structure of a Compiler
1. Lexical Analysis
2. Parsing
3. Semantic Analysis
4. Optimization
5. Code Generation


## Cool (Classroom Object Oriented Language)

1. Compiles to MIPS (coolc file.cl -> file.s)
2. Run MIPS via emulator (spim file.s)

## Regex

- 'c' = {"c"}
- A + B = A and b - form a set of {A,B}
- A B = A or B - form set of {A|B}
